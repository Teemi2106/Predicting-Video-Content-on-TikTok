# Predicting-Video-Content-on-TikTok
I recently worked on an exciting project where I developed a predictive model to determine whether TikTok videos contain a claim or offer an opinion. Leveraging a dataset that captures user reports of videos and comments flagged for content review, I aimed to address the backlog of reports by creating a model that prioritizes content moderation efficiently.

Using sklearn's DecisionTreeRegressor, I trained the model to classify videos, helping to streamline the moderation process. This project allowed me to dive into exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and the practical application of machine learning techniques.

It was a great learning experience that not only honed my skills but also contributed to understanding how predictive models can be applied to real-world challenges.
